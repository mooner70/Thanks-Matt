            <h3>Licenses and Restrictions</h3>
            <span>
                This site is owned and operated by Baldridge Photography (hereinafter "we", "us", or a similar term). Material found at this
                site (including visuals, text, displays, databases, media, and general information) is owned or licensed
                by us. Unless otherwise indicated, individuals may: post material from portions of this site to another
                website or on a computer network for their own personal, noncommercial use; and view, download, and print
                materials from this site for their own personal, noncommercial use. In this regard, materials may not
                be posted from this site to another website. In addition, materials from this site may be reproduced
                by media personnel for use in traditional public news forums unless otherwise indicated. Any other use
                of information or materials found at this site, including any use by organizations or legal entities,
                is not permitted without our prior written permission. (See “Permission to Use Copyrights and Trademarks”
                below.) Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve sole discretion and right to deny, revoke, or limit
                use of this site, including the reproduction and any other use of any materials available through this
                site. It is not our responsibility, however, to determine what “fair use” means for persons wishing to
                use materials from this site. That remains wholly a responsibility of individual users of this site.
                Furthermore, we are not required to give additional source citations, or to guarantee that the materials
                of this site are cleared for any alternate use. Such responsibility also ultimately remains with individual
                users of this site. However, we maintain the right to prevent infringement of Baldridge Photography materials
                and to interpret “fair use” as we understand the law.

            <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
            <span>
                You agree that you will not individually, or as part of any collective effort, submit or post information to this site that
                could be deemed harmful or offensive to other users, nor will you impersonate another user in order to
                hide your identity or implicate another in such actions. You agree to do nothing that might disrupt the
                flow of data to and from this site, impact the service or performance of this site, or circumvent any
                of the controls or usage rules that we have implemented. You understand that the result of harmful or

            </span>
            <h3>Linking</h3>
            <span>
                For your convenience, this site may contain links to websites operated by others. Such third-party sites are not maintained
                or controlled by us, and we are not responsible for their content. Although we have made a good faith
                effort to link only to tasteful, appropriate sites, some may contain inappropriate or objectionable material.
                If you find such material while using a website that you accessed through a link on this site, please
                notify us immediately. We believe that those who make information available on the Internet expect that
                it will be publicly and widely available. Therefore, we believe that linking to other sites is legally
                permissible and consistent with the expectations of those who use the Internet. However, if access to
                a particular website should be restricted, the operator of such site should promptly notify us.
            </span>
            <h3>Jurisdiction and Applicable Law</h3>
            <span>
                This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Texas, United States of America, as applied to agreements entered
                into and to be performed entirely within the state, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts
                of law. Any action you bring to enforce this Agreement or any matters related to this site shall be brought
                in either the state or federal courts located in Denton, Texas, and you hereby consent and submit to
                the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action. If any provision
                of this Agreement is unlawful, void, or unenforceable in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall
                not be affected, unless we determine that the invalid or unenforceable provision is an essential term
                to the Agreement, in which case we may at our sole discretion amend this Agreement.
            </span>
